This paper discusses the modelling of four machine learning algorithms for predicting the progression of scoliosis. This project aims to identify the progression or non-progression of spine curvature for those with scoliosis.

Our paper uses only four algorithms: logistic regression, decision tree, k-nearest neighbours, and random forest. This project compares the confusion matrix results of each algorithm using only optimal hyperparameter from each model. The logistic regression and k-nearest neighbours produce the best and efficient result. However, between these two k-nearest neighbours gives higher accuracy. Our dataset's size is small, and the data set is imbalanced, due to which results are not 100% accurate.
